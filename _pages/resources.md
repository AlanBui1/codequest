### Getting Started:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (This is the language we will be using during the camp) 

- [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/) (This is a helpful guide for coding in Python)

- [Replit](https://replit.com/signup) (Replit is an online code editor and it's handy if you can't download Python!)
